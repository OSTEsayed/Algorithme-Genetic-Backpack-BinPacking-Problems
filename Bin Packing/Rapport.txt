First: For the Explination of the Code I commonted each command And make it Clear to understand Please check The Source Code For Information 

Second(the how to use):
    1)enter The number of dataset you want to use (4-7-8)
    2)enter The Size of population you want (for dataset4 we recommend 10, for dataset 7 and 8  we recomond 100)
    3)enter The Number OF itiration you want (for dataset 4 we recommend 10 , for dataset 7 and 8 we recommend 100)
    4)Congrats You got your best solution and best population 

Third: The Resaults printed :
    1-the first randomly generated population 
    2-the capacity of The "sac A Dos"
    3-the Best (final) Population (solution)
    4-size of population and number of itiration(generations) used 
    5-the Profits value for each chromosom in the population in order
    6-the capacity size for each chromosom in the population in order 
forth:the method used 
    -for The Codage . we used binary  
    -for the selection we used randomly by propability (the Roullet methods) the higher your fitness value the higher chance you got for selection 
    -for the crossover we cross at The half of the chromosom first half of the first father and second half of the second father .... same for the second child 
    -for mutation we randomly chose two point and reverse them


ps:sorry for the bad english...
